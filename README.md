"fake-sdk" is what I used to build https://hub.docker.com/r/doanac/fake-sdk

You have to update the .sh files with the name of your LmP device.

build example with:
```
  ./build-example.sh example-led
```

run example with:
```
  ./run-example.sh example-led
```

drop into a shell to poke around with:
```
  ./run-shell.sh example-led
```
